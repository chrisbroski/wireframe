Wireframe
=========

When developing a piece of software, a valuable part of the process is a wireframe of the user interface. This serves as a visual example of the specification and is a starting point to test and improved usability. Designers can use pencil and paper, a digital image, or dedicated wireframing tool. I prefer to use HTML and have developed some tools for building and using these.
