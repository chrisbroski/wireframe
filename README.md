Wireframe
=========

Like a biological organism, software has a development life cycle that starts with a plan and matures in stages until it is ready to be released into its intended environment. The stages between an idea and completion determine if the end product will be a highly functional member of society or a malformed monstrosity that should never leave the laboratory.

There are ways to increase the chances that your software is successful. (And ways to ensure certain doom.) One helpful but underused technique is the creation of wireframes - highly simplified diagrams that demonstrate basic functionality. A "bare bones" UI can communicate software requirements better than a pile of words to both stakeholders and developers. [Some even claim that written spec is a complete waste of time.](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch11_Theres_Nothing_Functional_about_a_Functional_Spec.php) Wireframes can be used during requirements gathering to make plain to stakeholders the repercussions of their requests and to uncover requirements that are missing, forgotten, or taken for granted. Usability feedback can be acquired from end users using a wireframe before significant time is spent on development. 

Wireframes can be created with pencil and paper, as a digital image, or with a specialized tool (like [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).) I prefer to use HTML for several reasons.

* **Dynamic interaction**: Wireframes in HTML demonstrate not only static layout, but interactive functionality as well.
* **Easy sharing**: HTML was built for the web, making sharing wireframes simple and easy.
* **Reusable code**: If the final product is going to build its interface based on HTML, the wireframe can be reused as a starting point for development.

There are drawbacks too.

* **Learning curve**: The abililty to build UIs out of HTML takes more time to acquire than drawing with pencil and paper. I'd argue it takes less time than Photoshop, but if you've already know how to use it, that's no consolation.
* **Misleading purpose**: It is hard to tell the difference between a wireframe designed for quick demonstration and a poorly made application.

Learning HTML is a solvable problem - invest the time in learning it. The second problem has less obvious solutions. If you show somebody a UI scrawled in crayon on a cocktail napkin, they naturally look past the crudeness and focus on the idea it is attempting to communicate. A quick HTML page looks much better, but people expect more from it. They can have a difficult time looking past the "ugliness" of the design. I have found several effective techniques to prevent this that I will share with you and offer some tools to assist.
