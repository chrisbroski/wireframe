Wireframe
=========

Like a biological organism, software has a development life cycle that starts with a plan and matures in stages until it is ready to be released into its intended environment. These intermediate stages determine if the end product will be a highly functional member of society or a failed experiment that can never leave the laboratory.

In between the requirements and production is where the magic happens. There are ways to greatly increase the chances of your software being a success. (And ways to ensure certain doom.) One helpful but rarely utilized technique is the creation of wireframes - highly simplified diagrams that demonstrate basic functionality. A "bare bones" UI can communicate software requirements better than a pile of words to both stakeholders and developers. [Some even claim that written spec is a complete waste of time.](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch11_Theres_Nothing_Functional_about_a_Functional_Spec.php) Wireframes can be used during requirements gathering to make plain to stakeholders the repercussions of their requests and to uncover requirements that are missing, forgotten, or taken for granted. Usability feedback can be acquired from end users using a wireframe before significant time is spent on development. 

Wireframes can be created with pencil and paper, as a digital image, or with a specialized tool (like [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).) I prefer to use HTML for several reasons.

* **Dynamic interaction**: Wireframes in HTML demonstrate not only static layout, but interactive functionality as well.
* **Easy sharing**: HTML was built for the web, making sharing wireframes simple and easy.
* **Reusable code**: If the final product is going to build its interface based on HTML, the wireframe can be reused as a starting point for development.

There are drawbacks too.

* **Learning curve**: The abililty to build UIs out of HTML takes more time to acquire than drawing with pencil and paper. I'd argue it takes less time than Photoshop, but if you've already spent the time to learn of to create digital media, that's not helpful.
* **Misleading purpose**: It is hard to tell the difference between a wireframe designed for quick demonstration and a poorly made application.

Learning HTML is a solvable problem - invest the time in learning it. The second problem is harder to find a solution to. If you show somebody a UI scrawled in crayon on a cocktail napkin, they should naturally look past the crudeness of the media and focus on the idea it is attempting to communicate. A quick HTML page looks way better, but people expect more from it and have a hard time looking past the "ugliness" of the design. I have found several effective techniques to prevent this that I will whare with you and give you a few tools to assist.
